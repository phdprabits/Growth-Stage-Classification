# Growth-Stage-Classification
There are two python codes in this repository. The code file 'GrStageClass_rice.py' uses spectral band data and spectral indices data to classify crop growth stages of rice. Similarly, 'GrStageClass_cotton.py' is used for the growth stage classification of cotton. The field data is not provided in this repository due to the lack of data sharing permissions. A screenshot of the data format is attached to the repository.

Sample data is provided for rice crop for band data only. The data is for testing purpose only. The csv data can be used with  'GrStageClass_rice.py'.
