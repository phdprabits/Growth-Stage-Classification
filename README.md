# Growth-Stage-Classification
There are two python codes in this repository. The code file 'GrStageClass_rice.py' uses spectral band data and spectral indices data to classify crop growth stages of rice. Similarly, 'GrStageClass_cotton.py' is used for the growth stage classification of cotton. The field data is not provided in this repository due to the lack of data sharing permissions. A screenshot of the data format is attached to the repository.
